    "description": "We pick ingredients from the local forest such as bilberry, wild raspberry, gorse flower, pine and moss. These are ground by hand in a pestle & mortar with traditional gin ingredients, including Organic Juniper, Organic coriander seed, liquorice and vanilla.\r\nThese freshly ground ingredients are then distilled just once in our tiny 30 litre pot still, before the addition of an incredible blend of Earl Grey Tea by Cheshire blenders Quinteassential, along with our own spring water from the ground beneath the distillery.\r\nThe resulting spirit retains all of the herbal, earthy flavours of Forest Gin, whilst the addition of the Earl Grey Tea blend adds sumptuous, delicate notes from oolong, cornflowers and Sicilian bergamot",

  "about": "The Lymm Beer Festival was the brainchild of the Lymm and District Round Table member Chris Stephens. Started in 2011, the Lymm Beer Fest has quickly established itself as a firm favourite with local people and has become one of the three main annual charity events organised by Lymm and District Round Table in order to raise money for local charities and community groups. The other events are the Lymm Charity Duck Race and the Big Lymm Fireworks.\n\nThe event will take place in the Lymm Village Hall and will offer over 35 carefully selected real ales, ciders and perries. Lymm Ladies will also be serving a fantastic selection of gins. There will be live music involving a host of talented local bands and singers, and a selection of food to purchase, with all profits going to charity. For those abstaining or driving we will also be offering free soft drinks."
