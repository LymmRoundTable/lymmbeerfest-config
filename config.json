The other events are the Lymm Charity Duck Race and the Big Lymm Fireworks.\n\nThe event will take place in the Lymm Village Hall and will offer many carefully selected real ales, ciders and perries. Lymm Ladies will also be serving a fantastic selection of gins. There will be live music involving a host of talented local bands and singers, and a selection of food to purchase, with all profits going to charity. For those abstaining or driving we will also be offering free soft drinks."
